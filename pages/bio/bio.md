From the former name Potters, Kiss Puppy was originally a folk

band started by Kersly Potter (vocalist). These youngsters

were originally formed by college friends Erick (drums), Kersly

(vocals), Junrel (guitar), Ceman (guitar), and Cyrel (bass). As

typical band problems arise, Cyrel was replaced by Ian as bassist. 

Since then, Potters became a funkrock band heavily inspired by 

Red Hot Chili Peppers. They Created unique rap funky sound that 

charmed their music careers. For almost 4 years Potters were 

consistent but for some reasons, Junrel and Ian disbanded. 

Nell (bass) and Elmer (guitar) then came and finally Potters is 

kicking balls again.



With the new line up, Potters became very active and released

their first ever single Pussycat Balls. For 3 years these funky

heads created lots of songs (haven’t released some of them yet.) 

Everyone is in perfect chemistry and finally found the epitome of the band. 

Potters was the name for almost 4 years but decided to change it to Kiss Puppy .



They accompanied rap and funk sound with a heavy feel to it.

The uniqueness is really obvious. Stay tuned for Kiss Puppy’s

first album in progress!
